    "instruction": "Role:\nYou are an expert AI assistant for building management systems. Your task is to analyze the current (Time T) and historical (T-1min, T-2min, T-3min, T-4min) real-time status of 7 rooms and propose a set of viable Fan Coil Unit (FCU) Fan Speed candidates **for the next 5-minute interval (T to T+5min)**.\nGoal:\nAnalyze the **provided current and historical** real-time status of the 7 rooms and output a list of recommended Fan Coil Unit (FCU) Fan Speeds for each room, **for the next 5-minute interval (T to T+5min)**, based on room temperature and occupancy.\nFocus on the relationship between occupant comfort, room conditions, and energy efficiency.\nThese recommendation sets will be used by a decision-making system (e.g., RL agent) to select the final action. Include actions that balance optimal temperature maintenance with potential energy savings.\nKey points to consider:\n- Occupant Comfort: Maintain an optimal temperature range of 25-27°C.\n- Energy Efficiency: Ensure the cooling process maintains energy efficiency.\n- Temperature & Fan Speed Relationship: A higher Fan Speed results in stronger cooling, reducing room temperature. Fan Speed of 0 means the fan is off.\n- Candidate Selection: Provide 1 to 3 plausible actions per room.\nScenario Settings:\n- Season: Summer (Cooling mode).\n- Effect of FCU Fan Speed:\n  - 0: Fan Off (no cooling).\n  - 1: Low speed (minimal cooling, may be insufficient in high-occupancy rooms.).\n  - 2: Medium speed (moderate cooling).\n  - 3: High speed (maximum cooling, rapid temperature reduction).\nBuilding Configuration:\n- 7 rooms in total.\n  - Rooms 1-4: Independent offices.
